Protect larger plants by covering them with plastic sheeting.\nAdd \u2153 cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nto 1 gallon water in the 5 gallon bucket. For larger jobs, use 1 cup bleach added to 3 gallons of water.\nPre-wet the surface to be cleaned with water\nApply the bleach and water solution to the surface with a scrub brush.\nReapply as needed to keep the surface wet for up to 10 minutes\nRinse the treated area thoroughly\nLet surfaces air dry\nRe-water any nearby plants that may be getting run-off\nAny leftover bleach and water solution can be easily flushed down the toilet. Rinse out your brushes and rinse off your gloves and boots with the garden hose, and let everything air dry. You can also use this technique to clean siding, as well as sealed brick and patio stones. Note that you should avoid applying the bleach solution in direct sunlight or to unfinished wood. The solution should not be used for aluminum gutters or windows; rinse thoroughly if any contact occurs. You should also test the bleach solution on the area you want to treat in an inconspicuous area before starting your project. Sure, it sounds easy enough, and really, it actually is! Here\u2019s a picture tutorial to help you see how it\u2019s done.\nMold and mildew builds up a little at a time over the winter. There\u2019s less daylight and lousy weather, making it easier to put off dealing with (until you can\u2019t any longer!).\nUse a large plastic tarp to protect the plants.\nTo make up 3 gallons of the bleach solution, use 1 cup of bleach. This makes it easier to dip a long handled brush into the solution. Measure water into the bucket and mark volume lines on the outside so it\u2019s easy to just use the hose to fill the bucket to the correct volume. No guessing as to how much a gallon is!\nWet the surface with a garden hose. When it\u2019s wet, the discoloration looks even worse.\nThe less you have to think about what you are wearing while you are working the better. Rubber rain boots and old clothes that you won\u2019t mind getting any bleach splashes on are perfect.\nUse a long-handled brush to apply (and reapply by just dipping the brush back in the bucket) the bleach solution to the wall.\nSome corners really can only be scrubbed with a hand-held brush. The gloves are really nice to have here:\nIf you have a large area to clean, don\u2019t try to do it all at once. To stay within the recommended 10 minutes of contact time, work in smaller sections, rinsing the first area before starting again on the next.\nWow \u2014 what a difference!\nThanks,\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n!
