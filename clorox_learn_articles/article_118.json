Is this a correct interpretation for all front loading machines? This is a big departure from having the bleach mix with the soap in the wash cycle at the beginning using a regular washing machine \u2013 any comments or advice? Big bleach users should be aware before buying.\nAnswer\nWOW. It\u2019s amazing that somebody actually reads those manuals. Getting to know your new HE washer is a great idea as they are very different from the old top loaders.\nMany things are different about liquid bleach usage in HE washers:\nThe bleach dispenser is located with all the other dispensers, and its small size can lead to challenges getting product into it\nThe bleach amount in the dispenser is less than the toploaders\nYou can\u2019t add liquid bleach directly to the washer once it\u2019s started\nThe liquid bleach is usually dispensed at the beginning of a rinse cycle rather than added with detergent, as with top loaders\nThe rationale for the later/rinse addition is that the detergent has done a lot of cleaning and the liquid bleach can work with or without the detergent. Adding in the first rinse should do a good job of finishing the cleaning, whitening and now disinfecting the clothes.\nAdvice- add as much bleach as possible since the HE washers also have larger clothes capacity and you want to get the best cleaning results.\nHope this helps and let me know if you have any further questions.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
