The dispenser drawer has separate compartments for detergent, bleach and fabric softener. How much bleach should I be using? Are there any other points to remember when adding bleach to my machine?\nAnswer\nThe simple answer for bleach usage in any HE washer is whatever the bleach dispenser capacity happens to be. The only way you can add products to a HE machine is via the built-in dispenser unit and it\u2019s almost impossible to add more without negatively impacting the products in adjacent compartments from the overflow. On the Frigidaire we have in the lab, there is a Min- and Max- level indicator. So, fill the dispenser to the top and that should satisfy your needs.\nWhile you are not adding as much as in a top-loader washer, less water and the fact that the bleach is dispensed a little later in the cycle means this will work for you.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
