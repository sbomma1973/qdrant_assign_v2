Start by checking care labels to see the fiber content; always avoid bleaching wool, silk, mohair, leather and spandex. Cotton, polyester, nylon and acrylic are generally safe for bleach when used as directed. For items with color, confirm that they are colorfast to bleach before presoaking.\nRelated Articles\nHow to Test Fabric for Colorfastness to Bleach\nWhat you need\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach with CLOROMAX\u00ae - Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\nMeasuring cup\nPlastic dishpan\nChlorine test strips\nPlastic spoon\nSteps to disinfect laundry\nPrepare a bleach pre-soak solution\nAdd 1/3 cup Clorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach to 1 gallon of water in the plastic dishpan.\nTip\nFor a large amount of laundry, you can use a top loading washer instead of the dishpan and add more bleach as needed to maintain the 1/3 cup bleach per gallon of water ratio.\nConfirm the bleach concentration\nUse a chlorine test strip to confirm the bleach pre-soak solution has a concentration of 1500 parts per million (ppm).\nTip\nIf the bleach concentration is too low, add more bleach and then test again.\nAdd the laundry to the bleach pre-soak\nFully submerge the laundry in the bleach and water solution and let it soak for 6 minutes. Use the spoon to make sure the items are fully submerged.\nTip\nThe laundry must remain in the pre-soak solution for 6 minutes to disinfect.\nDrain and rinse\nPour off the soaking solution and then rinse thoroughly. Or, if using a clothes washer, advance the dial to \u201cdrain\u201d to empty the washer. Advance the dial again to select a rinse cycle, or you can also just machine wash the laundry following the care label instructions.\nTumble dry\nIf available, machine dry the laundry. Note that disinfected laundry can also be line dried.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat if my laundry is not bleach-safe?\nIf the clothing is not safe because bleach will fade or discolor the dyes, but is made of fabric that is bleach-safe, you can decide whether or not disinfecting is more important than preserving the color. If you do want to try to preserve the color, washing in hot water and tumble drying on high heat for an extended period of time will help reduce germ counts, even if not to the level of disinfection (although possibly also with some fading, too).\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
