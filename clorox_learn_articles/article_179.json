On the show, they used a solution of equal parts water and bleach, sprayed it over a metal trivet, removed the trivet and then stopped the bleaching action. However, they didn\u2019t say how to stop the bleaching action. How can I use this method without ruining or weakening the material?\nAnswer\nI haven\u2019t seen the HGTV show that you mentioned, so I am not familiar with the process they used/recommended.\nHere\u2019s part of a response that I wrote for using liquid bleach to make \u201cdesigner jeans,\u201d which should be similar to the process you are attempting:\nPut some newspapers on the floor and start drawing your favorite designs.\nLet them dry 20-30 minutes, then use a wet paper towel to remove any excess bleach gel.\nRinse the bleached areas well in the sink to remove any excess bleach. (If you want to stop the reaction, you could add a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution to the area before rinsing. The reaction forms oxygen and should negate both products. Do a couple of rinses to be sure it\u2019s stopped.)\nDry and repeat on the backside of the jeans.\nI would be also be careful using a metal trivet, as these can react with the bleach and deposit some unwanted colors.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
