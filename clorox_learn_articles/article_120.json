It has narrow red and green pin stripes on a white background. Unfortunately, I did not notice the stain until about week after it happened.\nMy wife and I have tried scrubbing the stain with a brush and Shout Action Gel Advanced for set-in stains, Regular Shout, vinegar, lemon juice, Goo Gone, and a paste of baking soda to no avail. I should add that we washed the shirt in COLD water after treating and only dried it once after the first washing. We have not used\nClorox\n\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach\n(yet) because we did not know what effect it might have on the colored pin stripes.\nDo you have any suggestions, or is it just a \u201clost cause\u201d because of the time that has elapsed?\nAnswer\nOne of the best things to use for food grease stains including chili oil is actually liquid dishwashing detergent (the kind you use for hand washing dishes), because it is formulated for greasy dishes.\u00a0 Dish detergents with petroleum based cleaning agents work the best.\u00a0 Because liquid dishwashing detergent generally makes lots and lots of suds, you only want to use it for pretreating and rinse it away before you put the item in a clothes washer; otherwise you\u2019ll likely end up with excessive foam.\u00a0 You still should be able to get the stain out; here\u2019s what you can try:\nWork on the stains when the fabric is dry. That is, don\u2019t rinse them with water first.\nApply enough liquid dishwashing detergent to saturate each stain and gently massage it in.\nWait 5 minutes, and then rinse with warm water. Dish detergent should not go in a clothes washer so be sure to rinse thoroughly.\nPretreat again, this time with\nClorox 2\n\u00ae\nFor Colors Stain Remover and Laundry Additive\nto get the colored portion of the stain out. Rub a a little into any remaining stain. Wait 10 minutes (set a timer to help you keep track of the time).\nAfter 10 minutes of pretreating, machine wash the shirt in warm water using detergent and a little more Clorox2\u00ae.\nAir dry and check for success.\nI know the air drying step can be a real pain, but it\u2019s important\u2014damp or wet fabric can hide residual oil left behind.\u00a0If you miss any of the oily stains when you pretreat with the dishwashing detergent, you\u2019ll probably have some residual oil that you can get all the way out by repeating the treatment starting again on dry fabric.\nRelated products\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nStain Remover and Laundry Additive\nLearn more\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
