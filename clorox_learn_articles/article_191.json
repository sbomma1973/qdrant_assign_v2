I don\u2019t mind if the bleach lightens the fabric, it\u2019s just so soiled that I want it brighter.\nAnswer\nIf the slipcover is cotton or cotton/polyester, then you can wash it with\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n.\u00a0 Here are some other considerations for how you can proceed:\nWash in hot water using a good detergent and \u2153 cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n.\nIf the slipcover is very dirty, start by soaking the entire slipcover (and any cushion covers and matching throw pillows) fully submerged in a bleach solution of \u00bc cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nper gallon of water for 5 minutes.\u00a0 Drain the soaking solution and then wash as described above.\nAvoid shrinkage \u2014 keep the slip cover pieces out of the dryer.\u00a0Instead, put them back on the couch before they dry.\u00a0This is especially important for cushion covers, which need to be stretched over the cushions while still damp or they won\u2019t fit back on again.\nIf the slipcover is made of nylon or rayon, I would still expect it to be bleachable, but I would confirm this first with a bleachability test:\u00a0add 2 teaspoons bleach to \u00bc cup water and apply a drop of this solution to a less-visible part of the slipcover.\u00a0Wait 1 minute and then rinse and blot dry \u2014 any color change will give you an idea what to expect if you bleach the slipcover.\u00a0In fact you may even want to do this if the slip cover is made of cotton, and you may also want to check any topstitching thread to see if that will shift color when bleached.\nIf you decide you don\u2019t want to use bleach on the slipcover, then I would try an overnight pre-soak using\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors Powder\n.\u00a0Use a ratio of 1 scoop Clorox 2\u00ae per 2 gallons of hot water\u2014make sure the powder has completely dissolved and then add the slip cover to the soaking solution.\u00a0Make sure it is fully submerged (weigh it down if you need to) and let it sit overnight or up to 8 hours.\u00a0 Drain the soaking solution and then wash in hot water using detergent and more Clorox 2\u00ae.\u00a0Air dry as described above.\nLearn more about using\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Mist\nto sanitize leather and other soft surfaces\nhere\n.\nRelated products\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach with CLOROMAX\u00ae - Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nStain Remover & Color Brightener Powder\nLearn more\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
