When I started eating it, some of the oil from the cheese oozed out the side of the tortilla and down my cotton (light green) shirt and onto my blue jeans. Do you have any suggestions for how I should treat the stains?\nAnswer\nSince it is an oily stain, do not wet it before proceeding. The best option for this is to start by pretreating with a good liquid dishwashing detergent (the kind you use for handwashing dishes). Apply a little to the stain and rub it in; wait 5 minutes then rinse with warm water. It\u2019s very important to rinse away all the dish detergent because it shouldn\u2019t go in a clothes washer! Next, machine wash each item in the appropriate load (blue jeans in a dark load and the light colored shirt in a mixed color load) using a good laundry detergent and\nClorox 2\n\u00ae\nFor Colors Stain Remover and Laundry Additive\n.
