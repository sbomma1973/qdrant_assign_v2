I caught my youngest son spitting red Gatorade at his brother in our living room the other day. This room has multi toned brown to beige carpeting and we keep it very dark in there. Since I was extremely sick I didn\u2019t even notice that he had actually been spitting AND squirting the entire bottle all over. Two days later I\u2019m giving the house a deep cleaning because my landlord is coming over tomorrow to work on the house and I find this! Red/pink stains EVERYWHERE!! Do you think that I could use the Clorox Color Safe Bleach on it? I\u2019ve tried hydrogen peroxide and a stain remover and nothing is working! PLEASE HELP!\nAnswer\nThis is a very unfortunate situation. It\u2019s pretty much impossible for a mom of small kids to take a \u201csick day\u201d without everything falling apart.\u00a0 As far as using Clorox 2\u00ae for Colors, while it does work very well taking out Gatorade stains on fabric, the formula is a little too thick to use as a pretreatment product on carpet.\u00a0 The biggest issue is that it will be very difficult to completely rinse away, especially if you are trying to remove the stains without any special equipment.\u00a0 You mentioned that the two things you tried didn\u2019t work\u2013something else that should help is more powerful mechanical action, which for carpet means renting a steam carpet cleaner from your local hardware store.\u00a0 Because the stains are everywhere, you might as well just clean the entire room, so get both a general carpet cleaning product appropriate for the machine (they should have something available with the carpet rental) and a pretreatment stain remover.\nIf you would prefer a product specific for carpet, than you may want to try Formula 409\u00ae Carpet Spot and Stain Remover, which you can learn more about\nhere\n.\nI also wanted to mention that whether you use this product or something else, it\u2019s always a good idea to test your carpet for colorfastness on a part of the carpet that is hidden or less visible (think under a sofa).\u00a0 I would expect that most synthetic carpets would be perfectly fine for a wide variety of products, but not wool.\u00a0 Since you are renting, you probably don\u2019t\u2019 know what type of carpet you have, so all the more reason to test first.\nI\u2019m not sure how old your kids are, but since kids grow up (way too) fast, I can tell you that before you know it they will be old enough to bring you tea and make you soup, and leave you alone without destroying the house, and allow you to get some rest, so hang in there!\u00a0 I hope this helps\u2014good luck, and please let me know how it goes!\n\u2013Dr. Laundry\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
