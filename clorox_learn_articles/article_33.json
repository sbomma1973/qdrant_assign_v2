First there was sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), the bleach that is sometimes referred to as \u201cchlorine bleach\u201d (even though the bleach active is hypochlorite (\n-\nOCL), and there\u2019s no free chlorine in a bottle of regular bleach).\nNext came \u201cnon-chlorine\u201d bleach, which tells you what it\u2019s not, but doesn\u2019t tell you much about what it is: hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) bleach that is safe for nearly all machine washable colored fabric. That\u2019s why non-chlorine bleach is commonly called \u201cColor Safe Bleach\u201d or \u201cBleach for Colors.\u201d\nRelated Articles\nHow to Use Bleach in Laundry to Clean, Whiten, Remove Stains and Sanitize\nThe Difference Between Chlorine and Non-Chlorine Bleach\nGeneral rule for colorfastness\nIf you can machine wash a colored item with detergent, then you can also wash it with detergent and Clorox 2\u00ae.
