Even so, if you repeat the two-step pretreatment method including hand sanitizer and machine wash a few times, there\u2019s a chance you will successfully get rid of the marker stain! For more detailed steps, check out\nHow to Get Marker Out of Fabric and Clothes.\nCan I use full-strength Clorox\u00ae Bleach on ink stains?\nNo.\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nshould always be diluted with water first before allowing it to contact any soft or hard surface. Don\u2019t give in to the temptation to apply full strength bleach to ink stains \u2014 in time the area that was exposed to undiluted bleach could end up with a hole.\nInstead, if you have an ink stain on a bleach-safe item you can always pretreat it with a bleach and water solution made with \u00bc cup bleach added to \u00be cup water. Apply the bleach and water solution to the stain and then immediately machine wash the item using detergent and \u2153 cup Clorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach. Remember to pretreat with alcohol-based hand sanitizer first before applying the bleach and water solution!\nCan hand sanitizer stain clothes?\nAlcohol-based hand sanitizer (the ingredient list will say ethyl alcohol, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol) should not stain clothes. Alcohol-free hand sanitizers may include ingredients that do permanently stain or lighten clothes and should be avoided for pretreating. It\u2019s another reason why we only recommend alcohol-based hand sanitizer for pretreating ink stains.\nCan I get ink out of clothes after drying?\nInk stains that have been through a hot dryer will be more difficult to remove, but not impossible.
