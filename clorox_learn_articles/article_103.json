Our quick and easy colorfastness test shows you what to expect so you know when it\u2019s safe to use bleach.\nMore from Clorox experts\nBy\nMary Gagliardi\nDiscover more ways to clean.\nUse as directed.\nSome items with color actually can be safely bleached, but you can\u2019t usually tell just by looking, especially if they are incorrectly labeled \u201cdo not bleach\u201d. It doesn\u2019t depend on the color; it depends on what type of dye was used to color the fabric, and how it was applied. When you want to bleach colored clothes, don\u2019t just throw them in the laundry with some bleach. Testing first takes the guesswork out of knowing when you can use bleach.\nTesting clothing first by applying a drop of a bleach and water solution to a hidden area will help you know when it\u2019s safe to use bleach. When you don\u2019t see any color change where you applied the test drop, you can wash the item with bleach. When the item doesn\u2019t pass, the test area will change color. Since you only apply test drops to hidden areas, clothing that doesn\u2019t pass the test won\u2019t be ruined since the test area won\u2019t show.\nThe bleachability test is also very helpful when picking clothing or fabric to treat with bleach to intentionally change the color. By testing first, you\u2019ll know if a project (like using bleach to create tie dye effects) will actually work on the item you want to treat.\nRelated Articles\nHow to Use Bleach in Laundry to Clean, Whiten, Remove Stains and Sanitize\nWhat Is Color Safe Bleach and How to Use It\nWhat you need\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach with CLOROMAX\u00ae - Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\n2 teaspoons\nWater \u2014 1/4 cup\n1 cup capacity measuring cup\nMeasuring spoons\nSteps for testing colorfastness to bleach\nMeasure the water\nAdd \u00bc cup water to the measuring cup.\nMeasure the bleach\nAdd 2 teaspoons of\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nto the water in the measuring cup. Use the measuring spoon to stir the bleach into the water, then rinse the spoon with clean water.\nFind a hidden area\nTurn the item inside out so you can easily access the inside of the hem, pocket lining, or an inside seam. Testing a hidden area means a negative test result won\u2019t be visible.\nApply a test drop\nUse the smallest measuring spoon (\u215b or \u00bc teaspoon) to apply only a very small drop of the test solution to the fabric. Apply the smallest possible drop so it doesn\u2019t soak through to the outside. Wait 1 minute, then rinse and blot dry.\nTip\nIf your item has multiple colors, be sure to test each color, one at a time.\nLook for a color change\nIf there is no change to the color(s), then the clothing can be safely washed with\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n. Any change in color means the clothing is not safe for bleach. Wash these items with\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\n.\nTip\nIf you are testing an item to use for a DIY bleach project like tie dye, any color change shows you how well the item will respond to bleach. If the shirt you wanted to treat doesn\u2019t change color, you\u2019ll need to pick another one.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
