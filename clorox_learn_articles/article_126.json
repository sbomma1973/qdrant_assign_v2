The wool material is more absorbent than synthetic fibers and is more likely to hold onto the stain. And as wool tends to be more expensive, it\u2019s best to let the professionals do the job so that you can retain its value with minimum damage.\nWhat if I don\u2019t know what my carpet is made of?\nIn this case, we recommend playing it safe by calling the professionals. They\u2019ll be able to assess the situation and treat it accordingly.\nWhat if the stain is old?\nWe recommend still trying the steps above; Clorox\u00ae Urine Remover is a powerful stain remover! But the longer you wait, the more likely you\u2019ll need a professional.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
