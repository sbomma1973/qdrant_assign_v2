When used as directed, the sodium hypochlorite bleach active in Clorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach is highly effective at cleaning mold and mildew from a variety of bleach-safe surfaces, including glass window panes, vinyl or painted wooden window frames, grout and caulk.\nIf you prefer a ready-to-use product instead of mixing up your own bleach and water solution,\nClorox\u00ae Clean-Up\u00ae Cleaner + Bleach\ncontains the same bleach active and is also effective against mold and mildew. Note that these products are not appropriate for use on aluminum windows as they will cause discoloration. If you aren\u2019t sure what material your windows are made of, test first in an inconspicuous area.\nIf the bleach and water solution contacts any part of an aluminum window frame, rinse immediately with clean water.\nRelated products\nGather your supplies\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach with CLOROMAX\u00ae - Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\nMicrofiber cloths (multiple)\nWhite cotton washcloths\nWhite cotton bath towel\nMeasuring spoons\n24 oz. plastic spray bottle\nSafety glasses\nProtective gloves\nOld toothbrush\nPlastic bucket\nSteps to clean mold from windows\nPrep and ventilate the area\nRemove any window treatments from the window. Remove nearby rugs and place a towel under the window to protect the floor.\nTip\nIf desired, use a fan to circulate fresh air into the room where you will be working. Or if the room has multiple windows, open one nearby the window you are cleaning.\nPre-clean surfaces\nIf mold or mildew build up is heavy, first wipe surfaces with a wet microfiber cloth to reduce the amount of organic matter you have to deal with. Set the dirty cloth aside in the plastic bucket to wash later.\nMix the bleach and water solution\nWearing safety glasses and protective gloves, measure 3 cups of water into the spray bottle, then add 3 teaspoons of Clorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach. Insert the trigger sprayer into the bottle and tighten before adjusting the nozzle to spray a fine mist.\nTip\nBleach and water solutions must be made fresh daily.\nClean the window\nHold a cotton washcloth directly under the area you are going to spray to catch and wipe away drips as you are working. Spray the bleach and water solution onto the window; spraying additional solution as needed to keep the surface wet for up to 10 minutes. Wipe away drips with the washcloth and wipe the mold away with a microfiber cloth. In between sprays, use the toothbrush to gently scrub any mold out of corners or crevices.\nTip\nAdd dirty microfiber cloths and washcloths to the bucket as you work, switching them out for clean ones as needed.\nRinse the window\nSoak another microfiber cloth with clean water and then wipe all the treated surfaces to rinse away any residual bleach solution.\nDry the window\nWipe the window dry with another clean microfiber cloth.\nWash the cleaning cloths\nWhen finished rinsing and drying the window, immediately machine wash all the dirty microfiber cloths and washcloths together in the same laundry load. Select a heavy duty cycle and hot water, use a good detergent and add 1/3 cup Clorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach.\nNever mix ammonia or vinegar or any window cleaner with any bleach and water solution because hazardous gases can form.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow long does a bleach and water solution last?\nBleach and water solutions need to be made fresh each day that you use them because the bleach active, combined with your tap water, breaks down quickly into salt and water. Ready-to-use products, on the other hand, are formulated with a one-year shelf life when properly stored away from direct sunlight in a cool, dry place.\nWhat\u2019s the best way to dispose of a bleach and water solution?\nThe bleach and water solution can be easily disposed of by pouring it down any sink drain.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
