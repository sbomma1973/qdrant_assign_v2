I have raised beds where I rotate vegetables such as kale, beets and radishes, and my herbs are scattered throughout the garden in small beds and pots. In the rest of my yard, you\u2019ll find fruit trees, flowers, a cactus garden, composting area and tiki coop.\nBeware the fungi\nOne thing that I have to be mindful of in the garden is fungal disease. They can be harmful, and even deadly to many plants and wildlife. In food crops and plant species, fungal disease outbreaks can threaten our food supplies. Fungi have also driven more animal species extinct than other pathogens over the past 20 years.\n1\nStopping the spread in California\nAlthough it may not be the first thing that comes to mind, bleach is a simple, but powerful tool that is often used to help stop the spread of fungal diseases. Take for instance the California Department of Forestry, which uses\nClorox\n\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach\nto help manage and prevent the spread of a fungal pathogen that has threatened and killed the namesake California oak trees in Oakland.\nThe California Rice Commission turns to bleach to help control a fungus called\nFusarium fujiuroki\nthat has prevented rice crops from germinating.\nClorox\n\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach\nis also used by Amphibian Ark conservationists who rely on it to help contain a deadly fungus that is destroying frog and amphibian populations.\nUses for bleach in your backyard\nIn your own backyard\nClorox\n\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach\nis great for maintenance, and will not harm your grass or plants when used as directed.
