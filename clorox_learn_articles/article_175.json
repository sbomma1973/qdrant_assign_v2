They measure 60 inches by 90 inches.\u2028Can I bleach them in my washing machine?\u00a0 Also, does it help to thoroughly wet the fabric before placing it in the washing machine?\nAnswer\nIt sounds like you have an interesting project! Are you trying to improve the dingy appearance of older fabric, or are you trying to remove color?\u00a0You can definitely bleach large pieces of cotton/linen fabric in a clothes washer\u2014it\u2019s a lot like washing a very large tablecloth.\u00a0If I were doing something like this myself, I probably would proceed a little differently than what\u2019s in the video, which is for your basic every day load of white laundry.\u00a0You didn\u2019t say what type of clothes washer you have, so I\u2019ll address two options.\nTraditional top loading deep-fill model with central agitator\nStart with an empty washer.\u00a0Select the \u201clarge\u201d load size and the \u201cdelicate\u201d cycle, and then start the washer to fill with hot water. When it finishes filling, raise the lid (this usually stops the machine from agitating) and add the bleach.\u00a0For basic whitening, add 1/3cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n; to strip color, use more.\u00a0Close the lid so the machine agitates for a few seconds to mix the bleach, and then open the lid again.\u00a0Now you can add the fabric.\u00a0To do this, bunch the fabric together in a big loose wad and then slowly ease the bunched fabric into the washer.\u00a0Add the second piece of fabric in the same way, putting it in the washer across the agitator from the first piece. Ideally you can do both pieces of fabric together to balance out the washer, but if they are different colors then you will need to do them separately.\u00a0Be careful when adding the fabric to not wrap it around the central agitator!\u00a0When the fabric has been added to the washer, clothes the lid to restart the washer and let it run to completion.\nFor a top loader, I like a delicate cycle because the agitation speed is lower, which can help keep the fabric from getting tangled around the agitator. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to pre-wet the fabric before adding it to a top loader.\nFront loading high-efficiency model\nBegin with an empty washer. Select the hot water temperature and a delicate cycle and start the washer so it starts filling.\u00a0When the washer stops filling (you should hear the water shut off), stop the washer.\u00a0You may have to wait a minute or two for the door to unlock.\u00a0Once you can access the washer, open the door and add 1/3 cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n.\u00a0Close the door and restart the washer to mix the bleach and water for a few seconds, and then stop the washer again.\u00a0Now you can add the fabric, which you actually do want to pre-wet.\u00a0Bunch the wet fabric together in a big wad and then drop the bunched fabric into the water in the bottom of the washer.\u00a0Add the second piece of fabric on top of the first, pushing them down so they are submerged.\u00a0Now close the door and re-start the washer.\u00a0Let it run for about 5 minutes, and then stop the washer again.\u00a0Advance the dial to the end of the wash cycle and restart the washer so the machine can drain and begin the first rinse.\nFor a front-loader, I like the delicate cycle because the spin speed is lower.\u00a0This makes it less likely that a single large piece of fabric will throw the washer out of balance during the spin cycle. How easy it will be to manually advance the washer cycle to the end of the wash after 5 minutes depends the type of washer.\u00a0If you want to share more information on the type of washer you have, I may be able to provide more tips.\nYou didn\u2019t ask about detergent.\u00a0You certainly can add a little laundry detergent along with the bleach if you want.\u00a0It really depends on what your goal for bleaching the fabric is.\u00a0I hope this is helpful.\u00a0Please let me know if you have any other questions, and thanks for writing!\n\u2013Dr. Laundry\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
