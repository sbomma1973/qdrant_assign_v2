It can stink pretty bad and is hard to get the smell out in the laundry. It\u2019s not just in the underwear but in the blue jeans or pants they are wearing as well. I don\u2019t have an issue bleaching the underwear, but obviously don\u2019t want to bleach jeans or colored pants. What can I do to get rid of the smell?\nAnswer\nOh the memories\u2026 I noticed from your question that you said you are potty training children, so it sounds like you may have twins\u2014it was a big enough challenge for me training one child at a time! I have some good news for you\u2014more often than not, denim blue jeans can be safely laundered with\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n. You can use the bleachability test to check first. Just add 2 teaspoons\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nto \u00bc cup water and apply a drop of that solution to a hidden part of the blue jeans (like inside the pocket facing, or the inside hem). Wait one minute then blot dry\u2014no color change means you can safely bleach the blue jeans! You may also find that if the jeans fade slightly where the drop of test solution was applied, the color change is minimal and something you can live with. You can also use this test to confirm bleachability of the other colored pants\u2014just don\u2019t bother testing leggings or other pants that have spandex in them (check the care label) since spandex will yellow when bleached. Surprisingly, khaki pants are also often bleachable, just be sure to check first because it varies from brand to brand.\nFor pants that can\u2019t be safely laundered with regular bleach, you can wash them with detergent and\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors Stain Remover and Laundry Additive\n. Always rinse away any solids prior to laundering. Be sure to select a hot wash temperature and the heavy duty cycle to get the pants as clean as possible, and sanitize them by adding\nClorox\u00ae Laundry Sanitizer\nto the softener dispenser. This product is appropriate for all machine washable laundry, including colors.\nOf course you can also limit your kids to wearing only bleachable pants until they are potty trained!\nRelated products\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nStain Remover and Laundry Additive\nLearn more\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
