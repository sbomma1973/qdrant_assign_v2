Using proper technique and the right laundry products make it easy to keep them clean and white, wash after wash.\nMore from Clorox experts\nBy\nMary Gagliardi\nDiscover more ways to clean.\nUse as directed.\nTowels and bed sheets work hard to keep you dry, clean and comfortable. In the process they pick up stains, dirt and unseen \u201cbody soil\u201d made up of body oils, dead skin flakes and sweat. Washing with detergent alone is not enough to keep sheets and towels truly clean.\nThat\u2019s why good laundry habits combined with\nClorox\u00ae Bleach\nmakes all the difference. Clorox\u00ae Bleach breaks up stains, dirt, soils and organic matter, making it easier for your detergent to do its job. And Clorox\u00ae Bleach is EPA registered, so your sheets and towels aren\u2019t just cleaner and whiter, they\u2019re also germ free.\nHere are Clorox\u2019s tried and true tips for washing white sheets and towels for optimum cleaning and whitening:\nWash with hot water\nThe hotter the water, the better the cleaning. This makes a difference not just after one cycle, but also over time.\nUse the right detergent\nIf you have a High-Efficiency (HE) washer (either a front loader or top loader), make sure you are using an HE detergent. Check the ingredient list and make sure it has enzymes and an optical whitener in addition to the cleaning agents.\nAlways avoid bleaching wool, silk, mohair, leather and spandex.\nAdd the right amount of detergent\nUsing too much detergent can cause over-sudsing in the clothes washer, which cushions the load and reduces cleaning performance. This also makes it harder for the detergent to be completely rinsed from the load. Using too little detergent means you won\u2019t have enough cleaning agents to remove dirt and soil. Always measure, and follow the instructions on the detergent package.\nDon\u2019t overload the washer\nIt\u2019s very important that the laundry rotates or tumbles through the wash water freely. This is a challenge for large items like bedding and towels. Packing these items in too tightly means they won\u2019t agitate properly or get as clean. Also, try to put in an even number of towels or sheets so the load balances properly in the spin cycle. Properly balanced loads can spin at higher rpms, extracting more wash water from the machine for more thorough rinsing.\nAdd bleach every time you wash towels and bedding\nAdd\nClorox\u00ae Bleach\nalong with the detergent to get your sheets and towels as clean as possible. The difference in performance adds up over time, when sheets and towels washed with bleach are noticeably cleaner and whiter not just after one cycle, but all of the time.\nFor best results in a standard washer, dilute 2/3 cup bleach with 1 quart of water and add it 5 minutes after the machine has begun agitating.\nIf you have an HE washer, use the bleach dispenser to add the bleach and fill it to the \u201cmax-fill\u201d line.\nRelated Articles\nHow to Use Bleach in Laundry to Clean, Whiten, Remove Stains and Sanitize\nSkip the liquid fabric softener, especially for towels\nFabric softener leaves a coating on the fabric that may help control static cling, but also reduces absorbency. If you must use softener, stick to dryer sheets.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I bleach sheets and towels labeled \u201cDo Not Bleach\u201d?\n100% white cotton, and even polyester or poly/cotton sheets should be labeled \u201cAny Bleach When Needed.\u201d Know that some textile manufacturers cut costs by putting the most restrictive care instructions on everything regardless of how best to wash it, so they only have to make one type of care label.\nThis isn\u2019t fair to consumers, who rely on accurate information to know how best to care for a garment or textile.
