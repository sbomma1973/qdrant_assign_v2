I washed it a couple of times with vinegar (home remedy I read online) and it was no help. I\u2019m getting ready to wash it with Clorox2, do you think that will do it?\nAnswer\nUnfortunately\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors Stain Remover and Laundry Additive\nis a little too gentle to strip away the unwanted color.\u00a0 However, depending on the fiber content of the items that picked up the unwanted color, you may be able to restore the items with a diluted bleach and water solution using\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n.\u00a0 Not knowing all the specifics of the items, it\u2019s best to provide you some general information that you can adjust to your situation.\nFor white items that picked up color, first check each care label to identify the fiber content of each item so you know which ones are bleachable.\u00a0You should always avoid bleaching wool, silk, mohair, leather, and spandex.\u00a0 The first four are less commonly machine washed, but spandex (also called Elastane or Lycra) is sometimes included in garments and even small percentages shouldn\u2019t be bleached.\u00a0 For those fabrics that can be bleached, you should be able to restore them using a bleach soaking solution.\u00a0Start by adding \u00bc cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nto one gallon of water in a plastic dishpan.\u00a0Fully submerge items in the bleach solution for up to 5 minutes.\u00a0You may notice the color coming off immediately, or it may take the full 5 minutes (but don\u2019t let any item soak for longer than 5 minutes).\u00a0If you have a lot of items, it\u2019s better to do them one at a time, transferring each item as you finish to a second dishpan that you can immediately rinse the item in.\u00a0 If you have only one item, then after 5 minutes just drain the soaking solution and thoroughly rinse the item\u2014you can also just run it through a regular wash cycle with a little detergent and \u2153 cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n.\u00a0 Hopefully the unwanted color will be gone, but if it is lighter, then you can repeat the soak for eventual success.\nFor colored items that picked up the unwanted color (or white items that include spandex) you can try RIT Color Remover, which is available at craft and fabric stores, as well as some drug stores.\u00a0 When using RIT for this purpose, the trick is to mix up the solution so it is just strong enough to remove the unwanted color, but not so strong that it strips off the original item color.\u00a0You\u2019ll be working with your hands in the solution so be sure to wear gloves.\u00a0Start with a very weak solution by just using only a small amount of the powder, not the whole package, and dissolve it into a gallon of water in a plastic dishpan.\u00a0Dip the garment (all of it) into the solution and check to see if the unwanted color comes off.\u00a0The quicker you do this the more likely you will preserve the original color.\u00a0Hopefully the color will come off right away and you can quickly rinse the garment very thoroughly in a little warm water.\u00a0If the RIT solution is too strong, you will see the original color coming off right away, so if that\u2019s the case rinse the item as fast as you can.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
