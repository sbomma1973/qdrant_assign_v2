In fact, a 7.5% sodium hypochlorite solution containing approximately 7.1% available chlorine by weight is a convenient, economical source of chlorine for water treatment in swimming and kiddie pools. Also, because this product is a liquid with no insoluble particles, it is especially suitable for this use. For the initial filling, use a bleach to water ratio of \u215b cup bleach per 100 gallons of clean water (use the chart below for guidance).\nRelated Articles\nHow to Clean Inflatable Pool Floats\nHow much bleach to add to your kiddie pool\nDon\u2019t guess\u2014always measure first.\nOnly a small amount of bleach is needed to treat the water in a kid\u2019s pool.

Before draining the water in a treated wading pool, contact your sanitary sewer and storm drain authorities and follow their discharge instructions.\nDo not enter the pool when the available chlorine level is 4 ppm or higher.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I use Clorox\u00ae Splash-Less\u00ae Bleach to disinfect my pool?\nNo\u2014instead, be sure to use\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n,\nClorox\u00ae Performance Bleach\nor\nClorox\u00ae Germicidal Bleach\n. Thickened bleach products or bleach products with added fragrance are not appropriate.\nHow often should I put bleach in my pool?\nIt depends on how many people are using the pool, how hot outside it is, and if the pool is in the sun. These are all situations where the bleach will break down faster and why you may need to add more bleach. By testing the water with the pool chlorine test kit, you will know if the available chlorine in the pool is too low, and that\u2019s when you would add more bleach. You want to maintain the pool chlorine level between 0.5\u20131 ppm available chlorine as measured by a test kit.\nHow do I know how much bleach to add to a square pool?\nA little math will get you to an equivalent diameter you can use. Divide the area of your pool (length x width) by 3.14 (the mathematical constant \u03c0). Take the square root of your answer, then multiply by 2, and this will give you an equivalent diameter. For a 7 foot pool:\n(7 x 7)/3.14 = 15.6; square root of 15.6 = 3.95; 3.95 x 2 \u2248 8 feet in diameter.\nI want to fill my 6 foot pool so it\u2019s 9 inches deep but that\u2019s not on the chart?\nTo fill your 6 foot pool to a depth of 6 inches, you would add 1/8 cup (or 2 tablespoons) of bleach. You want to increase the amount of water by 50% with an extra 3 inches of water, so add 50% more bleach, which in this case is an additional 1 tablespoon of bleach.\n1.\nBleach should be stored away from direct sunlight in a cool, dry place. When stored as directed, a bottle of bleach has a one-year shelf-life. This applies to both unopened and opened bottles.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
