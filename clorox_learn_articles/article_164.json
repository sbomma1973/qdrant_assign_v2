We want to change that, starting at the top with sodium hypochlorite.\nMore from Clorox experts\nBy\nMary Gagliardi\nDiscover more ways to clean.\nUse as directed.\nThe bleach active in\nClorox\u00ae Bleach\nis sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Historically, our bleach was made in a simple process beginning with passing an electric current through salt water to produce sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and chlorine gas (Cl2); these two products are then combined, producing sodium hypochlorite bleach\nIn fact, The Clorox Company\u2019s headquarters has always been in Oakland, California where the company founders first used the salt water from San Francisco Bay to make bleach! Once it encounters organic material (like dirt) or heat or sunlight, bleach very rapidly breaks down into salt (NaCl) and water, where it all began.\nWhere bleach comes from, starting and ending as salt water, is a big part of what makes bleach environmentally friendly.\nOther important bleach ingredients\nThe right formulation makes all the difference\nSodium hypochlorite works best when it\u2019s part of a complete formula with ingredients to enhance the bleach active. In addition to sodium hypochlorite and water, small amounts of sodium chloride, sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide are included for product stability and to maintain pH.\nSodium chlorate is naturally present in small amounts as an intermediate molecule during the natural breakdown of bleach to saltwater. Polyacrylic acid is included as an anti-redeposition agent. And finally, a polyelectrolyte complex improves brightening.\nRelated Articles\nThe Difference Between Chlorine and Non-Chlorine Bleach\nHow does bleach work?\nEffective and economical, bleach gets the job done\nSodium hypochlorite hydrolyzes double bonds, breaking up soils and stains to make it easier for the laundry detergent to do its job getting clothes clean. That\u2019s why adding bleach along with your regular detergent doesn\u2019t just sanitize the laundry; it also gets clothes cleaner and whiter than washing with detergent by itself. For household disinfection, sodium hypochlorite\u2019s ability to denature proteins makes it highly effective at killing bacteria, viruses and fungi.\nRelated Articles\nSurprising Uses for Bleach\nUse bleach as directed\nProper use ensures that bleach performs as promised\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nshould always be diluted with water first before using. When mixing up a bleach and water solution for home disinfection, use the amount of bleach and water recommended for your specific task.

And finally, bleach products have a one-year shelf life when stored in a cool dry place away from direct sunlight.\nRelated Articles\nHow to Sanitize Clothes, Bed Sheets and Towels\nBleach Dilution Ratio Chart for Disinfecting\nHow to Wash and Sanitize Dishes with Bleach\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is bleach made of?\nBleach is made of mostly water and sodium hypochlorite, the active ingredient that cleans and kills germs.
