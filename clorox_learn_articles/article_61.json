While COVID-19 is predominately spread through shared air, cold and flu germs can live on surfaces for days, which is why it\u2019s important to wash hands frequently and disinfect high-touch surfaces and objects.\nWhen determining what surfaces to disinfect, prioritize frequently touched areas and objects. This can include doorknobs, window latches, light switches, tabletops, countertops, bathroom sink, kitchen sink, toilets and faucet handles. Clean the surface first to remove dirt and grime as needed, let the surface dry, then disinfect hard, nonporous surfaces with a disinfectant like\nClorox\u00ae\u00a0Disinfecting Mist\nor\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Wipes\n. Make sure you always follow the product label instructions for proper usage and contact time.\nRelated products\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Mist, Multi-Surface\nLearn more\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Wipes\u2081\nLearn more\nHow can I keep my family safe from seasonal viruses?\nIt\u2019s important to establish healthy habits that you can sustain through fall/winter and beyond to protect yourself and your family from seasonal respiratory viruses like influenza, the common cold and RSV. We tapped Dr. Eva Beaulieu, a board-certified internal medicine hospitalist, to share her top tips.\nDr. Eva Beaulieu, a board-certified internal medicine hospitalist, shared her top tips for families navigating illnesses:\nGet Vaccinated:\nVaccines are your first line of protection against illnesses. Since many COVID-19 and flu symptoms overlap, it\u2019s especially important to stay up to date on vaccinations. The CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot annually. The CDC also recommends getting vaccinated against COVID-19 and receiving booster doses on schedule.\nPractice Targeted Disinfection:\nEstablish simple disinfection routines that you can practice daily to keep germs at bay. For example,\nClorox\u00ae\u202fDisinfecting Mist\nand\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Wipes\ncan help you easily tackle germy high-touch, high-traffic spots in and outside the home. I also like to keep\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Wipes On the Go\nin my tote and car for when I\u2019m out and about to disinfect regularly touched or high-traffic areas, such as grocery cart handles, door handles, subway and train handlebars, restroom sinks and toilets.\nHealthy Hygiene:\nEstablish good hygiene habits, like washing your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. When my kids were little, we would practice singing their A-B-Cs while handwashing, which takes about 20 seconds.\nListen to Your Body:\nProtect yourself and others by staying home if you experience any cold or flu-like symptoms.\u202fThe same goes for staying home after you\u2019ve been exposed to someone with a confirmed case of COVID-19.\nFull Body Health:\nTake care of your\u202fphysical health\u202fby getting a good night\u2019s sleep, staying hydrated and maintaining a balanced diet. These healthy habits can help protect your body and strengthen your immunity so you\u2019re more able to fight back against viruses.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
