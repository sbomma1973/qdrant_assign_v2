Should I separate these phases?\nBleach is environmentally friendly\nQuestion\nAnswer\nThere are several ways to add bleach to your washload. Our directions for a standard deep-fill clothes washer are to add bleach WITH the detergent as the wash water is filling and BEFORE the clothes are added. The reason is you want to dilute the bleach with water before adding the clothes. (NEVER pour full-strength\nClorox\n\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach\ndirectly on fabrics).\nAnother way to add bleach is to add it to the bleach dispenser if your washer has one. This delays the addition like the approach below and on new HE machines is usually the only way you can add bleach.\nFinally, on the label you will see \u201cFor best results\u201d where we recommend mixing the recommended amount of bleach in a quart of water and waiting 5 minutes into the wash cycle before adding the bleach to a standard washer.
