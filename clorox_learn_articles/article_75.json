Here\u2019s what that means.\nMore from Clorox experts\nBy\nMary Gagliardi\nDiscover more ways to clean.\nUse as directed.\nUsing bleach on whites\nLaundry bleaches have a long history of home consumer use. First, there was regular bleach (sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl) which was first used for white cotton fabrics. The hypochlorite bleach active (\n-\nOCl) in regular bleach is often referred to as \u201cchlorine bleach\u201d even though there\u2019s no elemental or free chlorine in a bottle of bleach or in the laundry when the bleach is added.\nRegular bleach is not safe for some dyes and fabric types, including spandex, wool, silk, mohair and leather. However, it is safe for cotton, linen, rayon, polyester, nylon and acrylic fibers, unless a dye or finish on the fabric is not compatible with bleach.\nTip\nLaundry bleach is always added along with detergent to improve cleaning, brightening, whitening and stain removal.\nRelated Articles\nHow to Use Bleach in Laundry to Clean, Whiten, Remove Stains and Sanitize\nHow to Kill Flu Germs and Disinfect Laundry\nRelated products\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach with CLOROMAX\u00ae - Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\nClorox\u00ae\nSplash-Less\u00ae Bleach\n1\n- Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\nUsing bleach on colors\nNext came oxygen bleaches (hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate, sodium carbonate) that are safe for virtually all machine washable fabrics. Peroxide bleach doesn\u2019t contain chlorine, and is referred to on garment care labels as \u201cnon-chlorine bleach\u201d.\nTip\nIf unsure bleach is safe for an item, test on a hidden area before washing with bleach. Always avoid bleaching wool, silk, mohair, leather, spandex, and non-fast colors.\nOxygen bleaches are also referred to as color-safe or all-fabric bleaches. These products are also ideal for washing white items with spandex that can\u2019t be washed with regular bleach.\nRelated Articles\nWhat Is Color Safe Bleach and How to Use It\nRelated products\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nStain Remover and Laundry Additive\nLearn more\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nStain Remover & Color Brightener Powder\nLearn more\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nStain Remover & Color Brightener Packs\nLearn more\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nMax Performance Stain Remover and Laundry Additive\nLearn more\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nFree & Clear Stain Remover & Color Brightener Packs\nLearn more\nBleach innovations\nNow, there are also\nBleach Packs\nand\nConcentrated Bleach Powder\nthat behave similarly to sodium hypochlorite bleach once dissolved in water.
