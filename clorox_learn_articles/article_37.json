I hope everyone has a relaxing and fun-filled holiday. One common 4\nth\nof July activity is a trip to the pool, but between the trek through the bathrooms to the time spent in the baby pool, blow-up pool toys can collect plenty of germs! Fortunately, blow-up pool toys that are made of vinyl or plastic can be sanitized with a solution of 2 teaspoons\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nper gallon of water.\u00a0 Wipe the bleach solution on, let stand 2 minutes, and then allow items to air dry (you don\u2019t have to rinse them, similar to sanitizing food contact surfaces).\u00a0 It will probably be easiest to do this when the toys are inflated.\u00a0 Also, plan ahead and think about where you will be doing the washing and rinsing\u2014if you will be doing this outdoors, you might want to get a large tarp to work on and use it to air dry the items on. Once you are finished just hose it off.\u00a0 If the toys aren\u2019t that big, you could also do this inside in your shower, taking care to close the door or curtain so the bleach solution doesn\u2019t splash onto other items in your bathroom, and leave the items in the shower to air dry.\nNote that if you are using the pool toys in a lake or reservoir with murky water, you may want to use a stronger solution to disinfect the toys: add \u2153 cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nto 1 gallon of water and apply the solution to the toys for 6 minutes, then rinse thoroughly and allow to air dry.\u00a0 For this stronger solution, if you will be working outside, water any nearby plants first to protect them from runoff.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
