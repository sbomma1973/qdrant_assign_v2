It\u2019s no question that common colds and the flu can stop families in their tracks, leading to sick days and missed school or work. Each year, adults in the U.S. get an average of two to four colds\n1\n, and around 8% of the U.S. population gets sick from the flu each season\n2\n.\nEstablishing healthy habits can enable you and your loved ones to help prevent the spread of illness-causing germs year-round.\nFirst, it is important to understand how viruses spread. Viruses can spread directly from person to person when someone sick coughs, sneezes and talks or indirectly via surfaces, like when an individual touches a contaminated surface then touches their own mouth, nose or eyes.\nYou can be contagious without symptoms.\nIt is possible for some otherwise healthy adults to infect others beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick\n3\n.\nViruses can survive on hard surfaces.\nFlu viruses can live on surfaces for up to 48 hours. People can get the flu by touching a surface or object that has the flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or their eyes\n3\n.\nThe health complications can be severe.\nComplications of flu can include bacterial pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections and worsening of chronic medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes.\n2\nLuckily, there are a few simple things you can do to help prevent the spread of viruses and minimize the impact of illness-causing germs on you and your family.\nSmart ways to outsmart germs.\nMaintain your immune system.\nProper diet, hydration, exercise and sleep are all key to maintaining good health. While a strong immune system doesn\u2019t prevent you from getting sick or passing a virus on to others, establishing these habits are beneficial to help maintain your physical health during cold and flu season.\nGet vaccinated.\nAccording to the CDC, a flu shot is the most effective way to help prevent spread of the flu virus. Talk to your doctor, or find a local vaccination center\nhere\n.\nFor COVID-19 related vaccine information, visit\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\n.\nDevelop good hygiene habits.\nYou should practice good hygiene year-round, but you can also adopt new habits to help prevent the spread of germs:\nWash your hands.\nYou should wash frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds.\nAvoid touching your face.\nTry not to touch your eyes, mouth or nose with unwashed hands.\nCough into your elbow.\nBe sure to practice this healthy habit to avoid germy hands.\nDisinfect high-touch surfaces.\nIt\u2019s important to know how to disinfect common high-touch surfaces and items. For hard, nonporous, high-touch objects like doorknobs, window latches, light switches, tabletops, countertops, bathroom sink, kitchen sink, toilets and faucet handles, we recommend\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Wipes\n.

There are a few key differences between cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting and when each method should be used.\nCleaning removes dust, debris and dirt from a surface by washing, scrubbing or rinsing; this method should be used to keep the home generally tidy and to remove dirt and crumbs.\nSanitizing reduces the bacteria identified on the product\u2019s label on hard, nonporous and soft, porous surfaces and in laundry.\nDisinfecting destroys or inactivates both the bacteria and viruses identified on the product\u2019s label \u2014 like influenza and rhinovirus \u2014 on hard, nonporous surfaces.\nRelated products\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Wipes\u2081\nLearn more\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Wipes\u2083 On the Go - 9 count\nLearn more\nFollow health guidelines.\nHealth guidelines can help us all to prevent the spread of germs.
