To keep them clean and your kids looking their best, start by routinely wiping shoes down with\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Wipes\n, especially white midsoles. You can also use\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Mist\nto keep odors under control in between washings.

It may take a little digging, but it\u2019s useful information, especially since care recommendations vary from brand to brand.\nWhen in doubt about the best way to care for your shoes, always test the products you want to try on a hidden part of the shoe before proceeding.\nWhat you need to hand wash canvas shoes and sneakers\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nStain Remover and Laundry Additive\nLearn more\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Mist, Multi-Surface\nLearn more\nNylon brush or old toothbrush\nPaper towels\nFan\nSteps to hand wash canvas shoes and sneakers\nRemove shoelaces and insoles\nIf the shoes have removable laces and/or insoles remove them and set them aside for cleaning.\nTip\nOnly wash shoelaces made of cotton, polyester or nylon; don\u2019t wash leather shoelaces.\nBrush away obvious dirt\nBrush away loose soils and dirt from the shoes with a dry nylon brush.\nTip\nMake sure the shoes are dry when you brush off loose dirt.\nMix the cleaning solution\nAdd 1 capful of liquid\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nto 1 quart of water.\nTip\nUse Clorox 2\u00ae full strength for pretreating obvious stains.\nScrub the outside\nDip the brush in the cleaning solution and scrub the outside of the shoe starting at the top of the upper portion of the shoe and working your way down toward the midsoles.

This is usually to protect the materials used to construct the shoe, like glue that holds the uppers to the midsole, and to prevent shrinkage, but it can also be to preserve materials like leather or beading or even silk.\nCan you put shoes in the dryer?\nRegardless of how you wash shoes and sneakers, keep them out of the dryer unless recommended specifically by the manufacturer. High dryer heat can damage shoes, so letting them air dry is usually the way to go.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
