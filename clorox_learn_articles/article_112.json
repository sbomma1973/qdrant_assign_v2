Other times you find yellow stains months after packing away your white clothes or a tablecloth.\nOf course it\u2019s best to treat a stain right away, but even a months-old stain can come out by presoaking or pretreating. White bleach-safe clothing like cotton or polyester are washed after presoaking with\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n; wash white clothes that include a little spandex after pretreating with\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\n.\nRelated Articles\nThe Difference Between Chlorine and Non-Chlorine Bleach\nHow to Bleach White Shirts with Colored Logos, Embroidery or Print\nWashing stains immediately is ideal\nThe sooner you treat most stains, the easier it will be to get them out just by machine washing with the right bleach product.

Detergent brighteners can hide stains, but in time the oil oxidizes and yellows.\nBreaking up the oil first with dish detergent so the bleach can do its job to get the stain out all the way is key. Pretreating with dish detergent followed by either presoaking or pretreating depending on the fabric is a great technique to use anytime you aren\u2019t sure what caused a stain.\nWhat you need\nLiquid dish detergent\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach with CLOROMAX\u00ae - Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nStain Remover and Laundry Additive\nLearn more\nPlastic dishpan\nLiquid measuring cup\nGloves\nLarge plastic spoon\nHow to bleach white clothes with stains\nPretreat stains with dish detergent\nStarting on dry fabric, apply enough liquid dish detergent to saturate the stain and gently massage it in.

That\u2019s because this is usually just degradation of the brighteners on the fabric, and it\u2019s not permanent.\nCan bleach cause yellow stains and how do you get them out?\nWhen bleach is used as directed, it will not yellow fabric. Unfortunately, misuse can cause yellow stains which cannot be removed. It\u2019s always important to follow label instructions, including only washing fabrics that are bleach-safe, using the recommended amount of bleach, diluting bleach with water first, allowing it to contact clothing only for the recommended amount of time and rinsing thoroughly. Bleach should never be used at full strength on any fabric or surface.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
