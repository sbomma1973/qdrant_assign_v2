Then you should figure out why the stains are appearing, so you can prevent them in the future.\nMore from Clorox experts\nBy\nMary Gagliardi\nDiscover more ways to clean.\nUse as directed.\nWhen mysterious orange spots appear on your shirts, pants or towels after washing, it\u2019s probably due to rust. These stains should be removed with a rust remover product, a strong acid available at hardware stores.\nOnce you get the stains out, it\u2019s time to figure out what caused them, and make some changes so they don\u2019t happen again.\nFirst, let\u2019s deal with the stains.\nSkip the bleach for rust\nBleach is great for removing many stains, but not this one. In fact, bleach (or any product that contains sodium hypochlorite) is an oxidizer formulated at an alkaline pH, which provides the perfect conditions to oxidize iron and make a rust stain even worse.\nUse a rust remover product\nRust removers are very strong acids \u2014 that\u2019s why they\u2019re effective. Always follow the label instructions to make sure you use the product safely, and wear heavy duty rubber gloves.\nFirst, test for colorfastness. Apply a drop of the product to dampen a hidden area and wait a few minutes before rinsing with water. No color change means the item is colorfast.\nTo remove stains, dampen the stained area with water first, then apply the rust remover product. When the stain is no longer visible, rinse with clean water and then machine wash as directed on the care label.\nAllow the item to air dry.\nNow it\u2019s time to figure out what caused the rust stains.\nInspect your washer for rust\nIf your washing machine is older, there could be rust on the inside of the washer. That rust can transfer to your laundry, especially if wet clothing isn\u2019t removed immediately after the rinse cycle. This can happen whether or not you use bleach to wash your laundry. Examine the inside of the washer, especially the drain holes in the basket, and look for any signs of rust. Replacing the clothes washer is necessary to eliminate this problem.\nTest your water for iron\nEven if your water looks clear, it can still contain iron oxide. Use a water test kit to identify any metals in your water, along with their concentrations. Once you know more about your water, it will be easier to fix the problem with a long-term solution:\nWater softening systems work well for eliminating lower levels of iron.\nWater filtration systems work well when higher concentrations of iron need to be removed.\nPrevent rust for the long-term\nWhole-house water filters and softener systems aren\u2019t cheap, but they can improve your water quality, especially if you have well water. Installing a long-lasting solution to eliminate iron from your household water will not only give you better laundry results, it can also reduce stains in your sinks and toilets.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I use a rust remover product for rust stains on shirts that say \u201cdry clean only\u201d?\nNo. Take your shirt to a dry cleaner and show them the stain, so they can properly treat it before dry cleaning.\nCan I use lemon juice or vinegar to clean rust stains?\nVinegar and lemon juice are weak acids, and typically aren\u2019t strong enough to remove rust stains.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
