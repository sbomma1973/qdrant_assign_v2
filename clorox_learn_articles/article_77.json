Despite what you may be thinking, properly bleaching fabrics will not destroy them. There, I said it! And it\u2019s not just because I work for Clorox. We\u2019ve done what seems like a ton of fabric safety research at Clorox and outside labs.\u00a0 When used as directed, we found it does NOT eat your clothing or ruin your washing machine. We\u2019ll take a look at some of the common tall tales I\u2019ve heard over the years about using bleach.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with the most common one and save a couple for later.\nKey Bleach Usage Hints:\nThe most important thing is to always read and follow label directions\nAlways use the proper amount\nNever pour full-strength bleach directly on fabric.\nDilute it using one of the three following methods.\nAdding to your bleach dispenser\nAdding with the detergent as the washer water is filling, but BEFORE adding clothes\nDiluting in a quart of water and adding 5 minutes into the wash cycle\nMYTH: Bleach wears down fabric and shortens its lifespan.\nTRUTH:\nFabrics will naturally deteriorate from wearing, washing and drying. Abrasion from normal wearing and contact with other items during washing and drying are the major contributors to fiber degradation.\u00a0 So when your socks get holes at the toes or when your t-shirt stretches out, most of the wearing out occurs just by being worn.\nWe evaluated a wide range of normally bleached items- socks, underwear, towels, bed sheets, t-shirts, dress shirts and baseball pants.\u00a0 Our lab tests have shown no significant difference in fabric damage after 50 wash cycles between detergent alone and detergent and liquid bleach.\u00a0 So what we have shown in our testing is liquid bleach does not significantly reduce the life of fabric when used as directed.\nMYTH: If a garment label says don\u2019t use bleach, do not bleach it.\nTRUTH\n: It\u2019s a shame but a lot of manufacturers will actually under-label items to minimize any legal liability.\u00a0 We know almost all cotton whites and most synthetic whites are safe to wash in liquid bleach.\u00a0 If a label on your whites says not to use bleach, use my bleachability test and test it in a hidden area.\nNot everything is bleachable.\u00a0 Remember to check the label. I don\u2019t recommend bleaching wool, silk, mohair, leather, spandex and non-colorfast colors.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
