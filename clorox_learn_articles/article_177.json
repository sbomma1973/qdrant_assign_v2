Unfortunately, my husband is a warm sleeper and now there are yellowed areas on our new sheets. Is it safe to bleach them?\nAnswer\nBecause the sheets are 100% cotton, you can definitely launder them with bleach and not damage the cotton fibers.\u00a0 What you don\u2019t know is whether or not the cream color is colorfast to bleach. You can test the sheets with a quick bleachability test using\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n. First, add 2 teaspoons of bleach to \u00bc cup water and apply a drop to a hidden part of the sheets (like the part that gets tucked into the mattress). Be sure to test any trim on the sheets, too. Wait 1 minute, blot dry, and look for a color change. No color change means you can safely bleach the sheets.\nAssuming the sheets pass, here are some tips to help you get the stains out. For the wash water temperature, I would use hot water, as well as a \u201cregular\u201d cycle.\u00a0 A higher wash temperature and increased agitation will definitely improve cleaning. I would also pretreat the stained areas with a little liquid laundry detergent prior to washing to break up any oily body soil that\u2019s part of the sweat stains.\u00a0 Just apply a little of the detergent directly to the stains and rub in. Wait 5 minutes, ensuring the detergent doesn\u2019t dry on the fabric, and then wash the sheets in hot water using detergent and \u00be cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n. When complete, air dry the sheets\u2014I always\u00a0 recommend air drying items that had stains so you can be sure they are all the way out before tumble drying items in a hot dryer (which can permanently heat set some stains). This should do the trick, but if the stains have been building up over time and have been in and out of a hot dryer since last fall, then you may need to repeat the treatment for complete success.\nIf the sheets don\u2019t pass the bleachability test, then you can try using\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors Stain Remover and Laundry Additive\n.\u00a0 Presoaking with the powder will be especially beneficial, especially if you can soak the sheets overnight in a deep fill washer. Select hot water and add a couple of scoops to the empty washer as it\u2019s filling with water. Swirl the agitator to dissolve the powder, and then fully submerge the sheets. Allow the sheets to soak overnight, and the next day drain the soaking solution.\u00a0 Wash the sheets in hot water using detergent and more\nClorox 2\u00ae\n.\nRelated products\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach with CLOROMAX\u00ae - Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nStain Remover and Laundry Additive\nLearn more\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
