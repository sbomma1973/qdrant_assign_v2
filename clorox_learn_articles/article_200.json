Find out whether or not ammonia disinfects and kills germs in laundry and if it disinfects as well as bleach.\nMore from Clorox experts\nDiscover more ways to clean.\nUse as directed.\nQuestion\nI know that bleach will sanitize laundry and washing machines, but I was wondering if household ammonia would also serve this purpose for non-bleachable fabrics.\u00a0If it can be used as a sanitizing alternative, how much ammonia would I need? I know there are other options like Quats and such, but they\u2019re expensive and difficult to come by.\nAnswer\nWhether or not you can use ammonia as a fabric sanitizer is not an easy yes or no answer. Remember that products sold in the U.S. with claims for sanitizing or disinfecting must be registered with the EPA. As part of the registration process, the efficacy of the product is established under specific use conditions, targeting specific organisms.\u00a0These conditions become the label instructions, which must be followed to get the desired results for germ kill.\u00a0Without an EPA registration, no instructions for killing germs can be provided. Vinegar has the same problem!\nThis is why we can\u2019t provide instructions for using other products like ammonia or vinegar for killing germs in the laundry. Unfortunately, there are many claims online that post sanitizing advice with various home remedies that can inadvertently mislead consumers. Fortunately\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nis EPA registered, and can be used to\nsanitize laundry\n, even some items with color that you have\nconfirmed are colorfast to bleach\n.\nAnd now for some really great news\u2014there ARE options for fabrics that aren\u2019t safe for bleach! You mentioned quats, or quaternary ammonium salts, which are the germ killing active in\nClorox\u00ae Laundry Sanitizer\n, which is EPA registered for laundry use. You simply add it to the softener compartment of your clothes washer, so it\u2019s very convenient to use. It\u2019s available from major retailers as well as on line, so now you do have options when bleach isn\u2019t appropriate!\nFinally, because you mentioned ammonia, I want to take this opportunity to remind you that\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nshould never be combined with products that contain ammonia or strong acids because hazardous gases may form.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
