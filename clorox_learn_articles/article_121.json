So\nClorox 2\u00ae\nis color-safe for pretty much all your washable colored items, but doesn\u2019t meet EPA disinfecting requirements.\u00a0 You may, however, be able to safely launder your colored items with\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n(as long as the fabric is bleachable\u2014always avoid bleaching wool, silk, mohair, leather, and spandex).\u00a0 You can check colored items you aren\u2019t sure about with a simple bleachability test:\nDilute 2 teaspoons bleach in \u00bc cup water.\nApply a drop of this solution to a hidden part of the sheets, like the hem that gets tucked in at the foot of the bed.\u00a0 For multicolored items be sure to check each color.\nWait 1 minute then blot dry.\u00a0 No color change means the item can be safely bleached.\nIt\u2019s hard to predict what colors will pass the test\u2013it really comes down to what dye is used and how it is applied. For any colored items that don\u2019t pass the bleachability test with\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n, you can at least reduce germ counts by washing them in hot water, and using the hottest dryer heat setting.\u00a0 Dryer heat doesn\u2019t completely kill germs, but it does reduce their counts.\u00a0 Other tips to consider include:\nWash items you are concerned about separately to help prevent germs from spreading to other items\u2014this can occur in the washer and when transferring/handling from the washer to the dryer.\nWash/dry items of concern twice to further reduce the bacteria count.\nMake the next load a white/bleach load to sanitize the clothes washer.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
