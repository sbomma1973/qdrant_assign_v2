You can use bleach to get the stain out once you know the colored parts are colorfast.\nMore from Clorox experts\nBy\nMary Gagliardi\nDiscover more ways to clean.\nUse as directed.\nWhen you have colored logos or embroidery on a white shirt, there\u2019s a good chance you can safely launder the shirt with bleach. First you need to confirm the shirt is made of bleach-safe fabric, then you can check a hidden part of the embroidery thread for colorfastness to bleach.\nMost embroidery thread is made of polyester, which is typically colorfast, so many items with logos are actually bleach-safe! This also applies to white items with printed logos and screen printed graphic tees.\nRelated Articles\nHow to Use Bleach in Laundry to Clean, Whiten, Remove Stains and Sanitize\nWhat Is Color Safe Bleach and How to Use It\nConfirm the shirt\u2019s fiber content\nCheck the care label to see what the item is made of. You can safely bleach cotton, polyester, nylon, acrylic and rayon. You cannot bleach spandex \u2014 even a small percentage \u2014 wool, silk, mohair, and leather. Once you confirm the fabric in question is bleach-safe, you can check the logo itself for colorfastness.\nWhat you need\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach with CLOROMAX\u00ae - Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\nWater\n1 cup capacity measuring cup\nMeasuring spoons\nSteps for bleaching a white graphic tee\nMeasure the water\nAdd \u00bc cup water to the measuring cup.\nMeasure the bleach\nAdd 2 teaspoons of\nClorox\u00ae Bleach\nto the water in the measuring cup. Use the measuring spoon to stir the bleach into the water, then rinse the spoon with clean water.\nTest the inside of the shirt\nTurn the shirt inside out and place the backside of the logo facing up so you can get to some of the embroidery thread. It\u2019s important to test on the inside so a negative test result doesn\u2019t show.\nApply the test drop\nUse the smallest measuring spoon (\u215b or \u00bc teaspoon) to apply only a very small drop of the test solution to the thread. Apply the smallest possible drop so it doesn\u2019t soak through to the outside. Wait 1 minute, then rinse and blot dry.\nLook for a color change\nIf the thread doesn\u2019t change color, then you can add the shirt along with the rest of your white items to your next bleach load. If the thread lightens or changes color, then the thread is not colorfast to bleach and should be washed with\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\n.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nMy logo shirt is colorfast. Can I treat a stain on it with full-strength bleach?\nNo! Never use bleach full strength to treat any soft or hard surface. Bleach should always be diluted with water first before it contacts fabric. To pretreat stains before washing with bleach, soak the entire item for up to 5 minutes in a solution of \u00bc cup\nClorox\u00ae Bleach\nper gallon of water before machine washing.\nCan I bleach white socks with colored stripes without hurting the stripes?\nProbably, but you should test the stripes first for colorfastness to bleach. Apply a small drop to the inside of the sock so no test solution soaks through to the front if possible. Even better would be if the toe is knit from the same color as the stripes and you can test the toe without worrying about a negative result showing.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
