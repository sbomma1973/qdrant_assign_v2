Not only is grilling perfect for entertaining and socializing, but it also provides an ideal way to get out of the kitchen during the hot summer months.\nHowever, before you fire up the grill for the first time this season, there is some simple prep work you can do that will ensure you get the perfect sear every time.\nFirst, if you are using a charcoal grill, be sure to empty any ash left over in the bottom from last year into a container and put it in the trash. Ash buildup can obstruct the grill\u2019s vents and make it difficult to control the temperature.\nNext, you\u2019ll want to clean the grill grates and make sure that any rust or food residue from the last use are removed.\nFinally, be sure to pre-heat the grill before you begin to cook. A simple but often overlooked step, pre-heating ensures that food will not stick to the grill grates. For extra protection against a sticky situation, wad up a paper towel, dip it in cooking oil and use tongs to wipe the oil-coated paper towel all over the grates.\nAfter the last burger has been eaten and the last lawn game has been won, be sure your tongs and other grilling tools are ready to go for next time. Cleaning your tools after each use will keep them in great shape for a summer full of cookouts.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
