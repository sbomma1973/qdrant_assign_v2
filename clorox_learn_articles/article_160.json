More concentrated solutions may not be safe for some surfaces, and never use bleach full strength on any surface.\nCan I leave the solution on longer?\nFollowing the recommended contact time for a bleach and water solution and not leaving it on longer than recommended is important to make sure the surface is cleaned safely without any damage. Always mix, apply and rinse bleach and water solutions as directed on the label to ensure safe use of the product.\nWhat surfaces can I use the bleach and water solution on?\nHard, nonporous surfaces including glazed ceramic tile, porcelain, glass, stainless steel, plastic laminate, sealed granite, vinyl and silicone are all surfaces you can use a bleach and water solution to treat mold and mildew when used as directed. Do not use on marble, non-stainless steel, aluminum, chipped porcelain and porous tile. If unsure, test an inconspicuous area first for surface compatibility.\nI also have a soap scum problem. Which should I treat first?\nIf you have soap scum and mold or mildew, treat the soap scum problem first with\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bathroom Cleaner\n.
