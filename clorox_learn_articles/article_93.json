Find out what water temperature is most effective for better laundry results when using bleach to wash clothes.\nMore from Clorox experts\nDiscover more ways to clean.\nUse as directed.\nQuestion\nRecently my family was cleaning my grandma\u2019s house. I was using hot water with bleach to wipe things down, thinking I was disinfecting the surfaces. My sister-in-law informed me that when you use hot water with bleach, you deactivate the bleach. I have never heard this before, is this true? She said to only use cold water with bleach when cleaning.\nAnswer\nWhen mixing up a bleach and water solution for sanitizing or disinfecting of hard, non-porous surfaces in your home, it\u2019s a good idea to use cool tap water to mix the solution. That\u2019s because when you increase the temperature of the water, the sodium hypochlorite bleach active will break down more quickly and could fall below the required concentration for germ kill. That the bleach active breaks down more quickly in hot water doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s completely deactivated, and I wouldn\u2019t assume you weren\u2019t disinfecting, especially if you were using a new bottle of bleach. However, if you were using an older bottle of bleach and you didn\u2019t use the solution right away, your sister in law could have been right that your solution wasn\u2019t strong enough for germ kill. You can find information on using\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nfor disinfecting hard, nonporous surfaces\nhere\n.\nUsing bleach in the laundry\nis different. Regardless of whether you select a hot, warm, or cold wash temperature, adding\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nalong with your detergent will give you better cleaning, whitening and stain removal compared to detergent by itself. Not every fabric or garment is suitable for hot water washing, but since the hotter the water the better the cleaning, it\u2019s good to select a hot water cycle when running a bleach load whenever you can.\nRemember that bleach has a one-year shelf life when properly stored away from heat or direct sunlight. If you don\u2019t store it properly, the bleach active will naturally break down more quickly. The fact that the sodium hypochlorite bleach active breaks down easily into salt and water is actually a big part of what makes bleach environmentally friendly. But it also makes it important to use the product properly, and I\u2019m glad you asked the question.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
