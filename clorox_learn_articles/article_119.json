I work at a company that uses Clorox to sanitize the floor and some of the equipment. I find that after cleaning, when the equipment is moved or the floor remains wet, a layer of \u201ccrystals\u201d is found. Trying to clean it using a mop and room temp water causes the crystals to spread into a thin layer, which is eventually removed.\u00a0 However, if I add more Clorox, it crystallizes further. I read in some of the other blogs that hard scrubbing and warm water is the best removal process, but I\u2019m more interested in prevention. What are the causes of crystallized bleach? Could a constant source of airflow (air filter system for example) cause the liquid in Clorox to evaporate quicker than expected forming the crystals?\nAnswer\nThe crystals you are observing are salt crystals.\u00a0That\u2019s because the sodium hypochlorite active in\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nbreaks down into salt and water (a big part of what makes it so environmentally friendly).\u00a0Also, note that undiluted bleach is mostly water \u2013 as the water evaporates, eventually salt crystals will remain.\nThere are several possibilities as to why you are seeing salt crystals on the floor.\u00a0The most likely reason is that the floor is not being rinsed thoroughly following cleaning or the bleach solution being used is too concentrated, making complete rinsing difficult.\u00a0The correct protocol for disinfecting floors, walls, vinyl and tiles is:\nPre-wash surface, then mop or wipe with a solution of 1/3 cup of bleach per 1 gallon of water. Allow solution to contact surface for at least 5 minutes. Rinse well and air dry.\nIf your job involves sanitizing food contact surfaces in a restaurant, you would use a different bleach solution and method than what we recommend for floors.\u00a0For all you \u201cfoodies\u201d, here\u2019s the protocol:\nTo sanitize food contact surfaces: wash, rinse and wipe surface area with a solution of 1 tablespoon of bleach per 1 gallon of water for at least 2 minutes. Let air dry.\nHas anyone else had problems with bleach crystalizing?\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
