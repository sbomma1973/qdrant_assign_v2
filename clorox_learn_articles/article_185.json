Learn how to get mold and mildew out of towels, sheets, and fabric and remove that musty mildew smell.\nMore from Clorox experts\nDiscover more ways to clean.\nUse as directed.\nQuestion\nHow do I get mildew off sheets and towels?\nAnswer\nThe first question to ask yourself is: are these items bleachable? If you are not sure, start with the care labels and make sure the fiber content is safe for bleach. Always avoid bleaching wool, silk, mohair, leather, spandex and non-fast colors.\nItems that are bleach-safe (like cotton and polyester, for example) can be checked for colorfastness to bleach with a quick test: add 2 teaspoons\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nto \u00bc cup water; apply a drop to a hidden part of the items; wait 1 minute then rinse and blot dry; no color change means the items are safe to bleach.\u00a0 If that is the case, the following approaches should work:\nAt a minimum, I would wash them immediately in hot water using detergent and \u2153 cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n.\nIf the mildew is very bad, consider doing a Clorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach soak: use \u00bc cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nper gallon of cool water; soak 5 minutes, then wash in hot water with detergent + \u2153 cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n.\nIf the mold/mildew is heavy, you may need to repeat treatment for complete stain removal.\nFor non-bleachable colors (or non-bleachable fabrics like wool, silk, mohair, leather, and spandex for that matter) it\u2019s difficult to remove mold and mildew completely since the best mold and mildew removers are products with sodium hypochlorite like\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n.\u00a0 Even so, you can try the following:\nCarefully brush off any obvious spores and then wash in the warmest water recommended on the care label with detergent and an oxygen bleach like our\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors Stain Remover and Laundry Additive\n.\nTry a 1 hour presoak with\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors Stain Remover and Laundry Additive\nfollowing label instructions.\nAir dry the items in the sun.\nI realize testing for colorfastness on towels is difficult because there isn\u2019t a truly \u201chidden\u201d area; applying a very small drop of the bleachability test solution on one side that will not be visible when the towel hangs on a rack is about the best you can do.\u00a0 It may also be worth it to let the towels fade a little with a bleach treatment if it means getting the mildew off.\nRelated products\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach with CLOROMAX\u00ae - Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nStain Remover and Laundry Additive\nLearn more\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
