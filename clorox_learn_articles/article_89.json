Learn how to get stains out of dish towels with bleach. Whiten your dish and kitchen towels and get them fresher than ever.\nMore from Clorox experts\nDiscover more ways to clean.\nUse as directed.\nQuestion\nMy dish towels and cloths can become quite stained from cooking, etc. What can I use to get them really clean? I have been using other detergents, but they do not come spot-free.\nAnswer\nDish towels definitely are a cleaning and whitening challenge given all the different ways they are used in a kitchen and the wide variety of stains they can pick up. Multiple factors play into how clean they get, too. It\u2019s not just what products you use (although that is important!); how you wash them also matters. Here are some considerations to help you get better results.\nPretreat any stains. Cooking stains often have an oily component, so pretreating first with liquid dishwashing detergent (the kind you use for handwashing dishes is really helpful at breaking up the oil. It is also very important to do this while the fabric is dry [that is, don\u2019t rinse the stain first]). All you have to do is apply a little detergent to the stain and thoroughly massage it in. Wait 5 minutes, and then rinse the treated area with warm water. Dish detergent doesn\u2019t belong in a clothes washer because of its high sudsing qualities, so rinsing is important.\nCombinations stains that have both an oily and a colored component should be treated again, this time with a product that will help with the stain color.\nFor white cotton dishtowels, presoak with bleach and water solution made with \u00bc cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nper gallon of water. Fully submerge the dishtowel for 5 minutes, then pour off the soaking solution before machine washing (step 3).\nIf you have dish towels with color, then use liquid\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors Stain Remover and Laundry Additive\nto pretreat the remaining stain. Apply the product full strength and gently rub in. Wait 10 minutes before machine washing. Use a timer if it helps you keep track of the time so the product doesn\u2019t dry out on the fabric.\nMachine wash: select hot water and the heavy duty cycle. The hotter the water the better the cleaning.\nFor white towels, use detergent and \u2153 cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n.\nFor colored dish towels, add a little more Clorox 2\u00ae along with the detergent.\nAir dry the towels\u2014make sure the stains are all the way out before machine drying.\nI also wanted to mention that if you have towels that are mostly white but have some color, you may be able to safely bleach them with\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n, but you should test first. To do this, add 2 teaspoons\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nto \u00bc cup water and apply a drop to a hidden part of the towel (the underside of the hem is a good spot). Wait 1 minute and then rinse and blot dry. No color change means you can safely launder the towel with\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nas directed.\nMany dish towels actually are made with bleach-safe dyes because dish towel manufacturers understand that kitchen towels really benefit from the cleaning and sanitizing you get from\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
