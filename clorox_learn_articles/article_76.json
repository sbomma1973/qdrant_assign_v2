An off-level clothes washer can also dispense bleach at the wrong time. Make sure your washer is level so it works properly.\nDon\u2019t overload the washer\nHigh-efficiency clothes washers use multiple low-volume rinses and high-speed spin cycles to remove detergent. When the washer attempts to increase the spin speed as part of normal cycle function, it checks to see if the load is off balance. If it senses this, it will only spin at a low speed, extracting less water and rinsing less efficiently. Properly loading the washer by following the instructions in the Use and Care Guide prevents this.\nUse the bleach dispenser correctly\nBleach dispensers automatically add the bleach to the wash water at a preset time in the cycle. When it\u2019s time to add the bleach, the compartment holding the bleach is flushed with water. All the bleach goes into the washer, and no bleach residue is left behind in the dispenser. This ensures that bleach doesn\u2019t carry over to the next load.\nTo make sure your bleach dispenser doesn\u2019t add the bleach at the wrong time, make sure your washer is level, and fill the dispenser only to the \u201cmax fill\u201d line. Adding too much bleach can cause the dispenser to add the bleach too early. Premature bleach dispensing can result in dye damage, so making sure your bleach dispenser is working properly is important.\nBleach naturally breaks down\nOnce bleach is added to the wash water, it quickly breaks down into salt and water as it interacts with soils and stains in the laundry. By the time the bleaching portion of the cycle has completed and the washer has drained away detergent and bleach, spun to extract wash water, and refilled with rinse water, the bleach concentration has been substantially reduced.\nBleach continues to break down during each additional rinse cycle, all while being further diluted and rinsed away as additional clean water is added during successive rinse cycles. By the time the wash cycle is complete, the interior surfaces of the clothes washer have no remaining residual bleach.\nSpray rinses help keep standard washers free of bleach\nWhere high-efficiency clothes washers have multiple rinse cycles, standard clothes washers sometimes have just one deep fill rinse cycle. This is usually followed by a spray rinse, where the washer spins and drains at the same time clean water is sprayed into the machine to provide additional rinsing of detergent, soil and bleach from the load. One deep fill rinse combined with a series of spray rinses is enough to completely remove any bleach from a standard clothes washer.\nSelect an extra rinse\nIf you still are concerned about bleach carryover, select an extra rinse cycle when washing a bleach load if your machine has the option.\nWipe down your washer\nNearly all bleach damage is caused by accidental drips or spills that aren\u2019t cleaned up, not by bleach residue inside the washer. When a darker item brushes against a bleach drip, you won\u2019t see any dye damage immediately; it will show up later, which is why it\u2019s easy to blame it on residue in the clothes washer when it\u2019s actually not. Wiping down the exterior of your clothes washer will keep this from happening.\nRelated products\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach with CLOROMAX\u00ae - Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\nRelated Articles\nHow to Use Bleach in Laundry to Clean, Whiten, Remove Stains and Sanitize\nBleach Dilution Ratio Chart for Disinfecting\nHow to Use Bleach to Keep Towels and Sheets White\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow do you add bleach in a standard washer that doesn\u2019t have a bleach dispenser?\nFor best results in a standard washer with no bleach dispenser, dilute the measured amount of bleach in 1 quart of water. Add to wash 5 minutes after the wash cycle has begun.\nHow do you add bleach in a high-efficiency washer with no bleach dispenser?\nWhen your clothes washer doesn\u2019t have a bleach dispenser and locks you out of the washer, then you can\u2019t use regular bleach. Instead, use\nClorox\u00ae Zero Splash Bleach Packs\n. These bleach products safely dissolve as the clothes washer fills with water, and are rinsed away just like regular bleach.\nCan I use bleach in a washer that heats the water in the machine?\nProbably not! In general, clothes washers that heat the water in the machine advise against sodium hypochlorite bleach. You can tell if your washer has an in-line heater if it allows you to select higher wash temperatures like 90\u2103. Check the Use and Care Guide for your washer to make sure you only use laundry products recommended by the manufacturer.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
