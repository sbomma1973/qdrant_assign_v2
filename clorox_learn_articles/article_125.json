A good oxidant will help get the stain out, but it will likely take repeating a treatment multiple times to fully remove the stain. That means you will likely end up with a cleaner spot than the rest of the rug, so I would plan on cleaning the entire rug once you get the stain out. Also, be sure to test any product you will use on the rug to confirm that it is color safe\u2014to do this, apply a small amount of the product to a hidden part of the rug and let it sit for 10 minutes, then rinse and blot dry. No color change means you can safely use the product on the rug. Adapting what I typically recommend for dye stains on fabric, I would try the following:\nRent a steam cleaner to use while you are treating the stain\nPretreat the stain with Clorox2\u00ae Laundry Stain Remover. This is a newer spray pre-treatment that includes hydrogen peroxide in the formula. Spray the product directly onto the stain and then after a minute, blot the area with a towel. Repeat this, using a fresh part of the towel to blot the stain.\nAfter 10 minutes of pretreating and blotting, use the steam cleaner to clean the stained area. This is important to extract the stain remover so it doesn\u2019t sit on the carpet too long. An upper limit of 10 minutes of contact time for pretreating is what we recommend for pretreating fabric with the product and you\u2019ll want to stay within that time limit.\nHopefully the stain will be gone, but if a little remains, then you can begin another 10 minutes of pretreating and blotting, followed by steam cleaning.\nClean the entire rug if the treated area is noticeably cleaner than the rest of the rug.\nRelated products\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nStain Remover and Laundry Additive\nLearn more\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
