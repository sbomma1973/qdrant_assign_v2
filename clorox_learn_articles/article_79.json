Here\u2019s a simple way to clean out your washer, and get your laundry smelling fresh again.\nMore from Clorox experts\nBy\nMary Gagliardi\nDiscover more ways to clean.\nUse as directed.\nHave you noticed a smelly off-odor in your washing machine or on your clean laundry, especially on towels when they get wet? Soil buildups on the inner workings of the washing machine are the likely cause.\nThat\u2019s because there\u2019s always a little water left behind inside the washer when the cycle is complete, whether you have a top or front load washer. It\u2019s where you can\u2019t see it, in the hoses and the pump, and even in the tub beneath the basket where you put your laundry. This water holds small amounts of soil and lint, which can build up over time. It\u2019s the perfect breeding ground for odor-causing bacteria to thrive. And when odor-causing bacteria transfer to your clothes, they smell, too.\nRoutine maintenance is key\nThis is why washing machine manufacturers recommend regular maintenance to keep your clothes washer clean and odor-free, and all your laundry smelling fresh.\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nis specially formulated with sodium hypochlorite bleach, cleaning agents and corrosion inhibitors to make running a cleanout cycle easy and effective.\nBe sure to run the bleach cleanout cycle when the washer is empty. Depending on how bad the buildup is, one cycle to clean your washer using bleach may not be enough. In fact, you may need to run several for the problem to be brought completely under control. After that, run a cleanout cycle at least once a month, and at most once a week.\nDo not put laundry in the washer when running a cleanout cycle.\nWhat you need\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach with CLOROMAX\u00ae - Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Wipes\u2081\nLearn more\nSteps to clean your washing machine\nSelect hot water\nChoose the hottest water temperature available on your clothes washer. This may mean selecting the \u201cheavy duty\u201d or \u201cwhites\u201d cycle.\nSelect an \u201cextra rinse\u201d\nMost washers have this feature as an option you can add to any cycle. If not, do this manually once the cleanout cycle is complete.\nAdd bleach to disinfect\nPour it into the bleach dispenser. Fill to the maximum level (the \u201cmax fill\u201d line).\nStart the cycle\nLet the cycle run all the way to completion.\nDo not put laundry in the washer when running a cleanout cycle.\nManually select an extra rinse if necessary\nIf you weren\u2019t able to program your washer with an extra rinse when setting up the cleanout cycle, do it manually now, and restart the washer. This may involve advancing the washer dial to the start of the rinse cycle on an older clothes washer. This ensures no bleach remains in the washer.\nRepeat steps 1\u20135 as necessary\nIf your high efficiency washing machine still has unpleasant odors, repeat the process.\nWipe it down\nDon\u2019t forget to give the exterior of your machine a quick once over with one or two\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Wipes\n.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan\u2019t I just leave the door to the washer open so it dries out?\nLeaving the door open is not enough to solve this problem, because soil buildups are still present. Leaving the door open between laundry loads means it just takes a little longer for the problem to develop.\nCan I use regular bleach to clean my washing machine?\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n, which contains the sodium hypochlorite bleach active, can be used to run a washer cleanout cycle.
