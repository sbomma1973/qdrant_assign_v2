This can include direct contact with mpox lesions, scabs or body fluids from a person already infected with the virus or indirect contact by touching objects, fabric (clothing, bedding or towels) or surfaces that have been used by someone with mpox. Therefore, the CDC and health experts recommend that people avoid close contact with anyone who may be infected with mpox.\nHelping to Prevent the Spread of Mpox\nAvoid Contact with Infected Individuals: To help protect yourself against person-to-person transmission, avoid close, skin-to-skin contact with individuals who are infected with the mpox virus or who have a rash that looks like mpox.\nAvoid Contact with Contaminated Items: Avoid contact with objects and materials that a person with mpox has used. Do not share eating utensils or cups with a person with mpox, and do not handle or touch the bedding, towels or clothing of a person with mpox.\nHand Hygiene: It's always important to practice good hand hygiene by washing your hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\nIf You\u2019re Feeling Sick: Most importantly, if a new and unexplained rash appears (with or without chills and fever), avoid contact with other people. Call ahead before seeking medical attention; or, if unable to call, tell staff upon arrival of any concerns about mpox.\nCaring for Someone Infected with Mpox\nIndividuals who have mpox, and do not require hospitalization, are recommended by the\nCDC\nto isolate at home for the duration of the illness. If you\u2019re caring for someone with mpox, they should isolate from others and anyone helping to care for them should use personal protective equipment like a mask and gloves when handling contaminated items like bedding or towels.\nAccording to the CDC, disinfection of surfaces is recommended for all areas (such as in the home and vehicle) where a person with mpox has been or is currently spending time as well as sanitizing any used linens, towels and clothing. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has activated its Emerging Pathogen Policy for mpox to support environmental hard surface disinfection. This means that product manufacturers can make off-label claims about a disinfectant\u2019s effectiveness against mpox.
