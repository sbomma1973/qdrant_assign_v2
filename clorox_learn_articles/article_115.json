There was some odor on a few of my darks that I needed to get out, and I was looking for some advice on how to get it out. If not bleach, then what do you recommend?\nAnswer\nThis is a great question that actually touches on several issues, so let me review them before I answer your question.\nAs a general rule of thumb, avoid bleaching dark colored clothing unless you have confirmed that it is bleach-safe. To test an item, do a quick bleachability test: mix 2 tsp\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nin \u00bc cup of water, apply a drop to a hidden area (hem, inside cuff, side seam) and blot dry. For multi-colored items, be sure to test each color since they all need to pass. No color change means the item can be safely bleached, but a loss of color means that even a small amount of regular bleach could cause damage.\nHE clothes washers can develop an off-odor from water that is left behind inside the washer\u2019s interior system. It is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria, but you can control the problem by running a cycle with \u00be cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\nonce a week, or every few loads if you do a lot of loads per week. These can be empty loads with bleach, or better yet, white loads with bleach.\nRemoving dark and colored loads promptly after the cycle is finished is another strategy to prevent odors from transferring from the clothes washer to the clothes.\nNow to answer your question: to get rid of the off-odor on your dark clothes, just re-wash the items following a bleach clean out cycle, and that should take care of it. And for extra cleaning and brightening of your dark clothes, add\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors Stain Remover and Laundry Additive\nalong with your regular detergent. Good luck with your new washer, and let me know if you have any more questions.\nRelated products\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\nStain Remover and Laundry Additive\nLearn more\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach with CLOROMAX\u00ae - Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
