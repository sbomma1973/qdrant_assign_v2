But great fades take time. Why wait? Soaking your jeans in a bleach and water solution is simple, and it\u2019s a great way to lighten them quickly and safely.\nTo get started you just need a few items, most of which you probably already have on hand.\nRelated products\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach with CLOROMAX\u00ae - Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\nWhat you need\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach with CLOROMAX\u00ae - Concentrated Formula\nLearn more\n1 cup\nClean blue jeans\n3% hydrogen peroxide\n1 cup\nLarge plastic dish pans\nMeasuring cup\nClean white towel\nProtective gloves\nSteps to lighten jeans with bleach\nPrepare the bleach solution\nWearing gloves, add 1 cup\nClorox\u00ae Bleach\nto 1 gallon cool water in the first dishpan, and swirl to mix.\nPrepare the peroxide fixing solution\nRinse the measuring cup with clean water. In the second dish pan, add 1 cup hydrogen peroxide to 1 gallon of water.\nSubmerge the jeans in the bleach solution\nBe sure you have gloves on! Carefully swirl the jeans around until they\u2019re saturated. Continue to swirl the jeans so that all areas are completely submerged in the bleach solution. Be careful not to splash any solution on yourself or your clothing.\nAfter about 2 minutes, check the color change\nRemove the jeans from the bleach solution to check how the color change is progressing (hold them over the dishpan to safely catch drips). If desired, return the jeans to the bleach solution and continue swirling to increase fading.\nStop the bleaching action\nWhen satisfied with the color change (or if 5 minutes have passed), submerge the jeans in the second dishpan with the hydrogen peroxide solution, swirling them around until the fabric stops fizzing.\nRinse jeans\nThoroughly rinse the pants several times with cool water.\nAllow to air dry\nRoll the jeans in the towel to squeeze out excess water and hang the jeans to air dry.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I use bleach to lighten jeans with spandex in them?\nYou have to be careful when bleaching jeans that contain spandex. Regular bleach can yellow spandex (that\u2019s why it\u2019s on the list of fabrics you shouldn\u2019t bleach) and it\u2019s more obvious on white fabrics. With denim, the inside (or \u201cwrong\u201d side) of the fabric is predominantly white because of the twill weave. Only a little white shows through to the front, so it could be worth a try to lighten the outside blue color even if there\u2019s some spandex.\nYou may want to try a shorter contact time in the bleach solution to minimize any potential yellowing. Also, be sure to thoroughly fix the jeans with the hydrogen peroxide to stop the bleaching action. This will help to limit discoloration of the spandex.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
