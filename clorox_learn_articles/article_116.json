I use Shout, do i need to turn clothes inside out, get it wet and spray?\u00a0 I dont know how to get the stain out.\nAnswer\nGreasy stains definitely need to be pre-treated before washing, and it\u2019s best to do this without rinsing the stain first, so you don\u2019t want to get the item wet.\u00a0 As far as what to use for pretreating, it depends on what type of grease.\u00a0 For food oil stains, you can get really good results by starting with a little liquid dishwashing detergent (the kind you use for hand washing dishes).\u00a0Apply a few drops to the stain and gently rub it in, making sure all of the stain is treated.\u00a0Wait 5 minutes, then rinse with a little warm water before machine washing the item.\u00a0For white bleachable items, machine wash in the hottest water recommended on the garment care label using detergent and 1/3 cup\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Bleach\n.\u00a0For items with color, machine wash in the warmest water recommended on the care label using detergent and\nClorox 2\u00ae for Colors\n.\nThis technique can also work well for lighter household oils (like lubricants for hinges, for example).\u00a0For heavier oils (like car engine oil), pretreating with a stronger solvent like \u201cGoo Gone\u201d (which you can find at hardware stores) can be helpful before machine washing as described above.\nI hope this helps!
