Find out if you can use Clorox Wipes on suede and microfiber sofas and how to clean a microfiber and microsuede couch.\nMore from Clorox experts\nDiscover more ways to clean.\nUse as directed.\nQuestion\nI am renting a furnished house. It has off-white colored micro suede chairs and a sofa. These are getting a dingy look from everyday wear. I know they are not supposed to get wet to avoid water stains, but is there a way to clean them? I was thinking of trying a Clorox wipe, which wouldn\u2019t get them saturated. Any suggestions?\nAnswer\nMicro suede is a synthetic fabric designed to look like natural suede, a type of leather made from the underside of an animal hide that has a soft, napped finish.\nSince micro suede is made of synthetic material (typically polyester), it is easier to care for than natural suede, and it actually may be okay to try to blot away stains with a damp cloth and then brush the nap to restore the finish. Typically, \u201cdamp cloth\u201d means just plain water and not a detergent or cleaning solution of some sort because that would alter the nap. That\u2019s why\nClorox\u00ae Disinfecting Wipes\nare not recommended for spot treating micro suede fabrics (or natural suede for that matter).\nCouches often have care instructions attached to the seat under the cushions. Start there to see what type of care is recommended. It\u2019s likely that bringing in a professional cleaner is the way to go, especially if the stains you report are from body soil that has built up over time. Plain water won\u2019t be enough to break up this type of stain. A professional upholstery cleaner will have a solvent-based solution that will hopefully restore the appearance.\nRelated products\nClorox\u00ae\nDisinfecting Wipes\u2081\nLearn more\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
