Learn how to clean your swimming pool using bleach instead of traditional chlorine.\nMore from Clorox experts\nDiscover more ways to clean.\nUse as directed.\nQuestion\nI have an in-ground pool and was told that putting\nClorox\n\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach\nin the water would help prevent algae during the winter. Is this true, and if so, how much would I need if my pool holds 33,000 gallons of water?\nAnswer\nThere\u2019s a protocol when using\nClorox\n\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach\nfor swimming pool disinfection to prevent algae growth when a pool is in use: on an ongoing basis, if you super-chlorinate the pool with 6-12 cups bleach per 5,000 gallons of water, in addition to regular chlorination, algae growth can be prevented. How much bleach you add and how often depends on several factors including how much the pool is used, sun exposure, and water quality.\u00a0 It sounds like from your question that since you are getting ready to close your pool for the season, the pool will not be used for awhile.\u00a0 In that case, I would use the high end of the recommended 6-12 cup range, and add 5 bottles (121 oz. size) plus an additional 3 1/2 cups plus an additional 2 tablespoons of\nClorox\n\u00ae\nDisinfecting Bleach\nto your 33,000 gallon pool.\n[Here\u2019s the math, if you are curious:\u00a0 33,000 gal. x 12 cups/5,000 gal. = 79.2 cups of bleach. To know how many bottles you will need, 79.2 cups X 8 oz./cup = 633.6 oz. needed. The large size bottle of bleach is 121 oz. so divide 633.6/121 to get 5.24 bottles of bleach needed. To convert .24 bottles (again, 121 oz. size bottle) to cups, multiply .24 x 121 oz. to get 29 oz. Remember that 1 cup = 8 oz, so you would need an additional 24 oz. (3 cups) + an additional 5 oz. ( 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons) in addition to the 5 full 121 oz. bottles. Whew!]\nThis treatment can be repeated as needed to keep algae growth under control while the pool is closed for the season\u2014keep an eye on the pool and look for any signs of growth before repeating the treatment.\u00a0 Also, if you decide to use the pool after super-chlorinating, you should first use a pool test kit to confirm that the ppm available chlorine in the pool is 3ppm or less.\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
