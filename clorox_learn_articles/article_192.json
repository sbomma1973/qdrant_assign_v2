Is it older, or did it just appear this week?\u00a0 Did it soak in or does it look like it\u2019s on the surface of the fabric?\u00a0 If the upholstery fabric has a stain repellent finish, the stain may come off just by gently rubbing across the stained area with no more than a little warm tap water applied to a wash cloth.\u00a0 I hope you are that lucky!\nHowever, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s more complicated than that.\u00a0 Stains on dining room chairs are most likely food and beverage stains, although I wouldn\u2019t rule out blood (which I know sounds gross but I try to focus on getting stains out, not pretending \u201cfeminine accidents\u201d never happen!).\u00a0 Cleaning badly stained upholstered chairs is best accomplished with a steam cleaner that can completely extract whatever cleaning solution is applied to the chairs, so it is worth renting the proper equipment.\u00a0 This also means using whatever cleaning products are recommended for use in the machine; information and products should be available with the rental.\u00a0 This includes pretreatment products\u2014you can check ingredient lists on the products to try different chemistries for the best chance of getting out your \u201cunknown\u201d stain.\u00a0 Look for the following:\nEnzymes\u2014blood stains\nSurfactants\u2014oily stains\nOxygen bleach\u2014red wine and other colored food stains\nWhether you rent your own equipment or bring in a professional company is up to you.\u00a0 Regardless, you should clean all the chairs in the set so they match in appearance when finished.\u00a0 This is especially important if it takes multiple cleanings to get the stain all the way out\u2014you could end up with one very clean chair compared to the others, especially if the chairs are older.\u00a0 If a professional charges per chair, this may tip the scales in favor of renting the equipment and making this a DIY project.\nI hope this is helpful.\u00a0 Please let me know if you have any other questions, and thanks for writing!\nGet the Clorox newsletter for tips & updates.\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the\nTerms of Use\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nSubscribe for tips & offers\nFollow us\nPool & Spa\nPine-Sol\u00ae\nFormula 409\nLiquid-Plumr\nProducts\nWipes\nSprays\nBleach\nBathroom\nLaundry\nKitchen\nAll Products\nLearn\nCleaning Floors\nLaundry Tips\nRemoving Stains\nKitchen Cleaning\nUsing Bleach\nCompany\nStart Clean\nCareers\nHelp\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\nContact Us\nFAQs\nAn important safety message\nBleach and other disinfectants are not suitable for consumption or injection under any circumstances.
